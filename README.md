# Bayesian-Stackelberg-Games
The three algorithms used to solve Bayesian Stackelberg Games have been implemented here: The Multiple LPs algorithm, The DOBSS algorithm and the HBGS algorithm.

All of them are functions in the three python files.

To use them, download the python file and replace the randomly generated game in the beginning with one of your own.

Both the reward functions of the attacker and the defender are three dimensional arrays and the probability distribution of the types is a one-dimensional array.

The output is the optimal strategy and the expected reward.
